Step 1: Create, Extract, Compress, and Manage tar Backup Archives
1.	Command to extract the TarDocs.tar archive to the current directory:
Answer: tar xvvf TarDocs.tar
2.	Command to create the Javaless_Doc.tar archive from the TarDocs/ directory, while 
excluding the TarDocs/Documents/Java directory:
Answer: tar cvvf Javaless_Doc.tar Java/
3.	Command to ensure Java/ is not in the new Javaless_Docs.tar archive:
Answer: tar tvvf Javaless_Doc.tar | grep -i Java
Bonus
•	Command to create an incremental archive called logs_backup_tar.gz with only changed files to snapshot.file for the /var/log directory:
Critical Analysis Question
•	Why wouldn't you use the options -x and -c at the same with tar?
Answer: the option “-x” and “-c” would not be able to be used together because both option counteract one another. “-x” extracts data while “-c” creates a backup

Step 2: Create, Manage, and Automate Cron Jobs
1.	Cron job for backing up the /var/log/auth.log file:
Answer: crontab -e 
With the crontab -l screen a time would need to be entered for when the back up should be created.
0 06 * * 3 tar cvvf auth_backip.tgz /var/log/auth.log 
The command above would create a daily task for the system to create a back up file for the auth.log file each Wednesday at 6:00 AM

Step 3: Write Basic Bash Scripts
1.	Brace expansion command to create the four subdirectories:
Answer: mkdir ~/backups/{freemem,diskuse,openlist,freedisk}
2.	Paste your system.sh script edits below:
#!/bin/bash
[cat free_memory_tool > ~/backups/freemem/free_mem.txt
 cat disk_use_tool > ~/backups/diskuse/disk_usage.txt
 ls -l /openlist/ > ~/backups/openlist/open_list/txt
 cat free_disk_tool > ~/backups/freedisk/free_disk.txt]
3.	Command to make the system.sh script executable:
Answer: chmod 755 system.sh
Optional
•	Commands to test the script and confirm its execution:
bash system.sh to run the script
ls -l to see the permission on the system.sh script and see if it is executable 
Bonus
•	Command to copy system to system-wide cron directory:
